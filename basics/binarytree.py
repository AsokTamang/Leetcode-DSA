#for full a binary tree, all the nodes in a tree must have either 0 node or 2 nodes which are left and right children nodes for a parent node
#complete binary tree is a binary tree whose last level is either full or the children nodes are in the left hand side
#perfect binary tree is a binary tree whose last levels or the last children nodes are in the same level
#balanced binary tree is a binary tree whose maximum height is logN where N is the total number of nodes in a binary tree.




#so in a binary tree , there are two ways to solve a problem and they are :
#BFS - breadth first search , in this search we go through every levels of the binary tree or every breadths of the binary tree
#DFS -depth first search , in this search we go deeper into the depth of the binary tree
#for DFS there are 3 types and they are:
#Inorder traversal
#in the inorder traversal the root node will be in the middle of left and right binary subtree
#Preorder traversal 
#in the preorder traversal , the root node will come before the left and right binary subtree  
#postorder traversals 
#in the postorder traversal, the root node will come after the left and right binary subtree
