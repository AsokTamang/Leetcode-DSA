#for full a binary tree, all the nodes in a tree must have either 0 node or 2 nodes which are left and right children nodes for a parent node
#complete binary tree is a binary tree whose last level is either full or the children nodes are in the left hand side
#perfect binary tree is a binary tree whose last levels or the last children nodes are in the same level
#balanced binary tree is a binary tree whose maximum height is logN where N is the total number of nodes in a binary tree.
